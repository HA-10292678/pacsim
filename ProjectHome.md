PACS is a simulation framework that allows seamless modelling, simulation and experimentation of emerging Cloud computing infrastructure and power aware services. PACS uses the CloudSim core simulation engine which is a discrete event driven simulator. PACS is a continuous event driven simulator comes with an efficient framework for managing datacenters using datacenter manager and host using host manager.

PACS offers all the features that is provided by the CloudSim including the additional features: (i) provides support for simulation of virtualized cloud based datacenter environments with dynamic VM provisioning (ii) prediction of future workload (iii) chip level power aware vm allocation (iv) random workload pattern generation (v) uses real time power saving states

The main contributions of this paper are: (i) implementation of different vm allocation policies like bestfit, worstfit, firstfit, binpacking etc. (ii) implementation of different vm schedulers like chip aware, non-chip aware, dynamic, binpacking vm schedulers, (iii) implementation of workload generation algorithms

The unique features of PACS are: (i) it automatically take care of power saving of datacenter by using power states (ii) predicting the future workload and kind of incoming jobs

By using PACS, researchers and industry-based developers can test the performance of a newly developed application service in a controlled and easy to set-up environment.
